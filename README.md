# Leaderboard

> A website displaying scores submitted by different players. It also allows users to add their score. The main goal of this project was to be able to deal with API and play with promises and async/await.

This project was divided into three (3) parts. Refer to the corresponding branch. The branch in bold is the one I am working on. 

1. Basic markup
2. API manipulations
3. **Final touches: styling**
